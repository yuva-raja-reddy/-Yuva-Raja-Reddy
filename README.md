Time to get your hands dirty!
Today's task, 'PY-074: Task2-Yuva Raja Reddy', is on the 'Python' Odoo  
Board now.
Please assign it to yourself and begin working on it.


- Set up a GitHub repository, create a class 01 branch, and document notes
in the README.md file as per instructor guidelines.

Key Activities:

- Create a new repository in GitHub with an appropriate name and
description.

markdown format for clear formatting and presentation.
- Stage, commit, and push the changes made in the class 01 branch to the
remote repository.

best practices.
